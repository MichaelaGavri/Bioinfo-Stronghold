My solutions to the problems on Rosalind.info

All solutions are written in Python by me as a learning exercise.
I deliberately avoided using AI tools and, in most cases, external libraries like
BioPython in order to better understand the underlying algorithms and concepts.
Some solutions could be written more elegantly with BioPython, but the goal here
is learning rather than prettines.
